TODO Run the scripts in task1 and task2 and complete TODOs

Every time script stops and asks you to do something you can freely explore and test solutions in console.
Don't be afraid - in case you break anything or need to start over just re-run the script. It will reset task state to the last TODO you've finished.
Just do not delete the scripts of corse...
Script do walks between folders automatically, you will have to do it manually while in console ( cd ../remote or cd ../local )
After finding correct command to use in every TODO please write it into this script.
